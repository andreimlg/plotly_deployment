# Plotly_deployment

The objective of this challenge was to built a dynamic dashboard that allows to visualize at a glance all the information of each volunteer. 
As part of the deliverables we created an horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart.

Also we identified several elements that can be customizable and can add more personality to your dashboard, the ones that were used in this example are:

* Add an image to the jumbotron.
* Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
* Make the webpage mobile-responsive.
* Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.


Here's the link to the dashboard:
